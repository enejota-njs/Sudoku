# Sudoku

Sudoku is a numerical logic game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, following three main rules: each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 regions must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. The game starts with some cells already filled in, known as clues or fixed values, and it is up to the player to deduce the remaining numbers using logical reasoning. Although it involves numbers, Sudoku does not require any mathematical calculations—only logic and attention. The difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle varies depending on the number of clues provided—the fewer the clues, the more challenging the game. Popular in newspapers, books, and mobile apps, Sudoku is widely enjoyed both as a pastime and as a way to exercise the brain.

## Programming Languages

- Java

## Contextualization

This product was developed as part of an academic project, designed with the purpose of implementing a functional application using the Java programming language. The proposal emerged within the context of curricular activities and was conceived to explore technical aspects of software construction, focusing on the structuring of a system based on logical rules and validations. The developed application represents the materialization of an idea applied in practice, integrating concepts of logic, modeling, and Java development, with the game of Sudoku as its central theme.

## Final considerations:

The development of this project was extremely useful for consolidating programming knowledge. Creating a functional application in Java allowed for practical exploration of important concepts such as logic, code structure, and object-oriented programming. The process also contributed to strengthening logical reasoning, autonomy, and the ability to solve problems in a structured way. Thus, the project proved to be an enriching and relevant experience for advancing learning of the Java language and software development in general.
